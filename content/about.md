Hi, I'm Skye. I'm an ordinary techie from Northern California! I love The Lord, my family, friends, animals, and the nerd stuff whether it's scripture or technology. My hope is to spread the Gospel and Software Freedom through the internet and in my community. I also enjoy hiking here in the beautiful NORCAL *(photos below ãƒ„ )!*

As I mentioned before, I love animals, so it's imperative I show you my pets.
